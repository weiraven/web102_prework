## Notes

The main challenge was ensuring the header and navigation bar were sticky without introducing unwanted horizontal scrolling or alignment issues. Managing consistent spacing and layout across all sections, especially the Stats and Our Games sections, required careful use of flexbox and CSS properties like max-width and margin. CSS always ends up being a game of trial and error since it's easy to forget rules and stylings if I haven't been actively using them everyday.
